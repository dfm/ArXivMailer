Carrying out the numerical simulations, we\ndetermine the nonperturbative running coupling constant in this renormalization\nscheme for the quenched QCD and Nf=12 SU(3) gauge theories. At first, we study\nthe quenched QCD theory using the plaquette gauge action. The TPL coupling\nconstant has a fake fixed point in the confinement phase.

The solutions are boundary condition free and which\nmake them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary\nconditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the\nwavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been\ntested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three\ndimensional enclosures of various shapes.

The dataset contains over 100 scenes and more than 400 images,\nincluding both 16-bit RAW formatted images and 8-bit BMP pixel and\nintensity-aligned images from 2 digital cameras (Canon S90 and Canon T3i) and a\nmobile phone (Xiaomi Mi3). We also introduce a method for estimating the true\nnoise level in each of our images, since even the low noise images contain a\nsmall amount of noise. Finally, we exemplify the use of our dataset by\nevaluating four denoising algorithms: Active Random Field, BM3D, Bilevel MRF\noptimization, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. We show that while the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron algorithm works as well as or even better than BM3D on synthetic\nnoise, it does not do the same on our dataset.\n", "id": "1409.8230", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "21 pages, 11 figures", "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "created": "2014-09-29", "authors": [{"forenames": "Josue", "keyname": "Anaya", "fullname": "Josue Anaya"}, {"forenames": "Adrian", "keyname": "Barbu", "fullname": "Adrian Barbu"}]}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2014-09-30", "authors": [{"forenames": "Hiroyuki", "keyname": "Abe", "fullname": "Hiroyuki Abe"}, {"forenames": "Tatsuo", "keyname": "Kobayashi", "fullname": "Tatsuo Kobayashi"}, {"forenames": "Hajime", "keyname": "Otsuka", "fullname": "Hajime Otsuka"}], "title": "Towards natural inflation from weakly coupled heterotic string theory", "comments": "22 pages", "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "doi": "10.1093/ptep/ptv075", "id": "1409.8436", "report-no": "WU-HEP-14-08, EPHOU-14-017", "first_author": {"forenames": "Hiroyuki", "keyname": "Abe", "fullname": "Hiroyuki Abe"}, "abstract": "  We propose the natural inflation from the heterotic string theory on\n\"Swiss-Cheese\" Calabi-Yau manifold with multiple $U(1)$ magnetic fluxes.

Specifically, by admixing lutetium and yttrium aluminate garnets\nwith gallium and gadolinium, the band-gap was altered in a manner that\nfacilitated the removal of deleterious electron trapping associated with cation\nantisite defects. Here, we expand upon this initial work to systematically\ninvestigate the effect of substitutional admixing on the energy levels of band\nedges. Density functional theory was used to survey potential admixing\ncandidates that modify either the conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band\nmaximum (VBM). We considered two sets of compositions based on\nLu$_3$B$_5$O$_{12}$ where B = Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb; and RE$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$,\nwhere RE = Lu, Gd, Dy, and Er. We found that admixing with various RE cations\ndoes not appreciably effect the band gap or band edges. In contrast,\nsubstituting Al with cations of dissimilar ionic radii has a profound impact on\nthe band structure. We further show that certain dopants can be used to\nselectively modify only the CBM or the VBM. Specifically, Ga and In decrease\nthe band gap by lowering the CBM, while As and Sb decrease the band gap by\nraising the VBM. These results demonstrate a powerful approach to quickly\nscreen the impact of dopants on the electronic structure of scintillator\ncompounds, identifying those dopants which alter the band edges in very\nspecific ways to eliminate both electron and hole traps responsible for\nperformance limitations. This approach should be broadly applicable for the\noptimization of electronic and optical performance for a wide range of\ncompounds by tuning the VBM and CBM.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.mtrl-sci"], "created": "2015-05-05"}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2015-12-22", "authors": [{"forenames": "Kazunori", "keyname": "Kohri", "fullname": "Kazunori Kohri"}, {"forenames": "Kunihito", "keyname": "Ioka", "fullname": "Kunihito Ioka"}, {"forenames": "Yutaka", "keyname": "Fujita", "fullname": "Yutaka Fujita"}, {"forenames": "Ryo", "keyname": "Yamazaki", "fullname": "Ryo Yamazaki"}], "title": "Can we explain AMS-02 antiproton and positron excesses simultaneously by\n  nearby supernovae without pulsars nor dark matter?", "first_author": {"forenames": "Kazunori", "keyname": "Kohri", "fullname": "Kazunori Kohri"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "doi": "10.1093/ptep/ptv193", "id": "1505.01236", "report-no": "KEK-Cosmo-170, KEK-TH-1821", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, to appear in PTEP", "abstract": "  We explain the excess of the antiproton fraction recently reported by the\nAMS-02 experiment by considering collisions between cosmic-ray protons\naccelerated by a local supernova remnant (SNR) and the surrounding dense cloud.\nThe same \"$pp$-collisions\" provide the right ratio of daughter particles to fit\nthe observed positron excess simultaneously in the natural model parameters.\nThe supernova happened in relatively lower metalicity than the major cosmic-ray\nsources.

We\nuse simulations to validate our method of measuring the slope of the $\\log\nM_*$-$M_{\\rm UV}$ relation, finding that the bias is minimized with a hybrid\ntechnique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with stacked\nphotometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do not\nsignificantly evolve over $z=$ 4-8, while the normalization of the trend\nexhibits a weak evolution toward lower masses at higher redshift. We combine\nthe $\\log M_*$-$M_{\\rm UV}$ distribution with observed rest-frame UV luminosity\nfunctions at each redshift to derive the GSMFs, finding that the low-mass-end\nslope becomes steeper with increasing redshift from\n$\\alpha=-1.55^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ at $z=4$ to $\\alpha=-2.25^{+0.72}_{-0.35}$ at\n$z=8$. The inferred stellar mass density, when integrated over\n$M_*=10^8$-$10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, increases by a factor of $10^{+30}_{-2}$\nbetween $z=7$ and $z=4$ and is in good agreement with the time integral of the\ncosmic star formation rate density.\n", "id": "1507.05636", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "27 pages, 17 figures, ApJ, in press", "updated": "2016-06-20", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "created": "2015-07-20", "authors": [{"forenames": "Mimi", "keyname": "Song", "fullname": "Mimi Song"}, {"forenames": "Steven L.", "keyname": "Finkelstein", "fullname": "Steven L.

In some of these studies, the multiple testing\nprocedure can be severely biased by latent confounding factors such as batch\neffects and unmeasured covariates that correlate with both primary variable(s)\nof interest (e.g. treatment variable, phenotype) and the outcome. Over the past\ndecade, many statistical methods have been proposed to adjust for the\nconfounders in hypothesis testing. We unify these methods in the same\nframework, generalize them to include multiple primary variables and multiple\nnuisance variables, and analyze their statistical properties. In particular, we\nprovide theoretical guarantees for RUV-4 and LEAPP, which correspond to two\ndifferent identification conditions in the framework: the first requires a set\nof \"negative controls\" that are known a priori to follow the null distribution;\nthe second requires the true non-nulls to be sparse. Two different estimators\nwhich are based on RUV-4 and LEAPP are then applied to these two scenarios. We\nshow that if the confounding factors are strong, the resulting estimators can\nbe asymptotically as powerful as the oracle estimator which observes the latent\nconfounding factors. For hypothesis testing, we show the asymptotic z-tests\nbased on the estimators can control the type I error. Numerical experiments\nshow that the false discovery rate is also controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure when the sample size is reasonably large.\n", "categories": ["stat.ME", "math.ST", "stat.TH"], "created": "2015-08-17"}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-20", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The response of the radio stations in the 30\nto 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of\nthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is\ndetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated\nusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due\nto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.\nThe spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of\nthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the\nAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air\nshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy\n-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy\nestimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the\nsurface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator\nscales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent\nemission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% for\nthe data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with at\nleast five radio stations with signal.\n", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.IM"], "created": "2015-08-18"}, {"title": "A Deep Bag-of-Features Model for Music Auto-Tagging", "first_author": {"forenames": "Juhan", "keyname": "Nam", "fullname": "Juhan Nam"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "abstract": "  Feature learning and deep learning have drawn great attention in recent years\nas a way of transforming input data into more effective representations using\nlearning algorithms.

While a number of promising results have been shown, it\nis not well understood what acoustic sense the learned feature representations\nhave and how they are associated with semantic meaning of music. In this paper,\nwe attempt to demystify the learned audio features using a bag-of-features\nmodel with two learning stages. The first stage learns to project local\nacoustic patterns of musical signals onto a high-dimensional sparse space in an\nunsupervised manner and summarizes an audio track as a bag-of-features. The\nsecond stage maps the bag-of-features to semantic tags using deep neural\nnetworks in a supervised manner. For the first stage, we focus on analyzing the\nlearned local audio features by quantitatively measuring the acoustic\nproperties and interpreting the statistics in semantic context. For the second\nstage, we examine training choices and tuning parameters for the neural\nnetworks and show how the deep representations of bag-of-features become more\ndiscriminative.

Our proposed distributed and cooperative control\nrecovery approach is applied to a team of five autonomous underwater vehicles\nto demonstrate its capabilities and effectiveness in accomplishing the overall\nteam requirements subject to various actuator faults, delays in invoking the\nrecovery control, fault estimation and isolation imperfections and\nunreliabilities under different control recovery scenarios.\n", "id": "1508.07076", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Zahra", "keyname": "Gallehdari", "fullname": "Zahra Gallehdari"}, "updated": "2016-06-20", "categories": ["cs.SY"], "created": "2015-08-27", "authors": [{"forenames": "Zahra", "keyname": "Gallehdari", "fullname": "Zahra Gallehdari"}, {"forenames": "Nader", "keyname": "Meskin", "fullname": "Nader Meskin"}, {"forenames": "Khashayar", "keyname": "Khorasani", "fullname": "Khashayar Khorasani"}]}, {"msc-class": "53C44 (Primary), 34A05, 34A30 (Secondary)", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-20", "authors": [{"forenames": "Christine", "keyname": "Rademacher", "fullname": "Christine Rademacher"}, {"forenames": "Hans-Bert", "keyname": "Rademacher", "fullname": "Hans-Bert Rademacher"}], "title": "Solitons of discrete curve shortening", "first_author": {"forenames": "Christine", "keyname": "Rademacher", "fullname": "Christine Rademacher"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "id": "1508.07274", "comments": "23 pages, 9 figures, revised version according to the suggestions of\n  the referees", "abstract": "  For a polygon in Euclidean space we consider a transformation T which is\nobtained by applying the midpoints polygon construction twice and using an\nindex shift.

The response of the conduction electrons\nin graphene to the local charge is monitored with scanning tunneling and Landau\nlevel spectroscopy, and compared to numerical simulations. As the charge is\nincreased, its interaction with the conduction electrons undergoes a transition\ninto a supercritical regime 6-11 where itinerant electrons are trapped in a\nsequence of quasi-bound states which resemble an artificial atom. The\nquasi-bound electron states are detected by a strong enhancement of the density\nof states (DOS) within a disc centered on the vacancy site which is surrounded\nby halo of hole states. We further show that the quasi-bound states at the\nvacancy site are gate tunable and that the trapping mechanism can be turned on\nand off, providing a new mechanism to control and guide electrons in graphene\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall"], "created": "2015-08-30"}, {"msc-class": "49J52, 37N05 (Primary), 37B55, 37G15 (Secondary)", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-12", "journal-ref": "SIAM J.

A challenge in answering this question is that the bifurcation\nbehavior of certain Arctic energy balance models have been shown to be\nsensitive to how ice-albedo feedback is parameterized. We analyze an Arctic\nenergy balance model in the limit as a smoothing parameter associated with\nice-albedo feedback tends to zero, which introduces a discontinuity boundary to\nthe dynamical systems model. Our analysis provides a case study where we use\nthe system in this limit to guide the investigation of bifurcation behavior of\nthe original albedo-smoothed system. In this case study, we demonstrate that\ncertain qualitative bifurcation behaviors of the albedo-smoothed system can\nhave counterparts in the limit with no albedo smoothing. We use this\nperspective to systematically explore the parameter space of the model. For\nexample, we uncover parameter sets for which the largest transition, with\nincreasing greenhouse gases, is from a perennially ice-covered Arctic to a\nseasonally ice-free state, an unusual bifurcation scenario that persists even\nwhen albedo-smoothing is reintroduced. This analysis provides an alternative\nperspective on how parameters of the model affect bifurcation behavior. We\nexpect our approach, which exploits the width of repelling sliding intervals\nfor understanding the hysteresis loops, would carry over to other positive\nfeedback systems with a similar natural piecewise-smooth limit, and when the\nfeedback strength is likewise modulated with seasons or other periodic forcing.\n", "categories": ["math.DS", "physics.ao-ph"], "created": "2015-08-31"}, {"msc-class": "11G05 (Primary), 11R21, 12F10, 14H52 (Secondary)", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-17", "authors": [{"forenames": "Harris B.", "keyname": "Daniels", "fullname": "Harris B.

This indicates thermalization of static fermionic\ncorrelations on the entire lattice. Second, the dynamical current-current\ncorrelations, including the time-resolved optical conductivity, also take the\nform of their thermal counterparts. Remarkably, both static and dynamic\nfermionic correlations thermalize with identical temperatures. Our results\nsuggest that the subsequent relaxation processes, observed in time-resolved\nultrafast spectroscopy, may be efficiently described by applying quasithermal\napproaches, e.g., multi-temperature models.\n", "id": "1509.08431", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "Improved version, to be published in Phys.

This effect is detected for central galaxies with a stellar\nmass larger than 10^10 solar masses and found to be strongest for red passive\ngalaxies, while blue galaxies exhibit a weaker trend. For galaxies with a minor\naxis parallel to the direction of the nearest filament, we find that the\ncoplanarity is stronger in the vicinity of the central galaxy, and decreases\nwhen moving towards the outskirts of the host halo. By contrast, the spatial\ndistribution of satellite galaxies relative to their closest filament follows\nthe opposite trend: their tendency to align with them dominates at large\ndistances from the central galaxy, and fades away in its vicinity. Relying on\nmock catalogs of galaxies in that redshift range, we show that massive red\ncentrals with a spin perpendicular to their filament also have corotating\nsatellites well aligned with both the galactic plane and the filament. On the\nother hand, lower-mass blue centrals with a spin parallel to their filament\nhave satellites flowing straight along this filament, and hence orthogonally to\ntheir galactic plane. The orbit of these satellites is then progressively bent\ntowards a better alignment with the galactic plane as they penetrate the\ncentral region of their host halo.

In particular, we characterize\nthe classical and parameterized complexity of the problem when the\nVapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension) of the input is small.\nVC-dimension is a natural measure of complexity of set systems. Several\ntractable instances of Hitting Set with a geometric or graph-theoretical flavor\nare known to have low VC-dimension. In set systems of bounded VC-dimension,\nHitting Set is known to admit efficient and almost optimal approximation\nalgorithms (Br\\\"onnimann and Goodrich, 1995; Even, Rawitz, and Shahar, 2005;\nAgarwal and Pan, 2014).\n  In contrast to these approximation-results, a low VC-dimension does not\nnecessarily imply tractability in the parameterized sense. In fact, we show\nthat Hitting Set is W[1]-hard already on inputs with VC-dimension 2, even if\nthe VC-dimension of the dual set system is also 2. Thus, Hitting Set is very\nunlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even in this arguably simple case.\nThis answers an open question raised by King in 2010. For set systems whose\n(primal or dual) VC-dimension is 1, we show that Hitting Set is solvable in\npolynomial time.\n  To bridge the gap in complexity between the classes of inputs with\nVC-dimension 1 and 2, we use a measure that is more fine-grained than\nVC-dimension. In terms of this measure, we identify a sharp threshold where the\ncomplexity of Hitting Set transitions from polynomial-time-solvable to NP-hard.\nThe tractable class that lies just under the threshold is a generalization of\nEdge Cover, and thus extends the domain of polynomial-time tractability of\nHitting Set.\n", "id": "1512.00481", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "to be presented at ESA 2016", "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["cs.DS", "math.CO"], "created": "2015-12-01", "authors": [{"forenames": "Karl", "keyname": "Bringmann", "fullname": "Karl Bringmann"}, {"forenames": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", "keyname": "Kozma", "fullname": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kozma"}, {"forenames": "Shay", "keyname": "Moran", "fullname": "Shay Moran"}, {"forenames": "N.

Relying on recent results on singular equivariant asymptotics of\noscillatory integrals, we further characterize the caustic behavior of the\nreduced spectral function near singular orbits, which allows us to give\ncorresponding point-wise bounds for clusters of eigenfunctions in specific\nisotypic components that are sharp.

Here we look at equilibration times for quantum gases of\nbosons and fermions in the regime of negligibly weak interactions, a setting\nwhich not only includes paradigmatic systems such as gases confined to boxes,\nbut also Luttinger liquids and the free superfluid Hubbard model. To do this,\nwe focus on two classes of measurements: (i) coarse-grained observables, such\nas the number of particles in a region of space, and (ii) few-mode\nmeasurements, such as phase correlators and correlation functions. We show\nthat, in this setting, equilibration occurs quite generally despite the fact\nthat the particles are not interacting. Furthermore, for coarse-grained\nmeasurements the timescale is generally at most polynomial in the number of\nparticles N, which is much faster than previous general upper bounds, which\nwere exponential in N. For local measurements on lattice systems, the timescale\nis typically linear in the number of lattice sites. In fact, for one\ndimensional lattices, the scaling is generally linear in the length of the\nlattice, which is optimal. Additionally, we look at a few specific examples,\none of which consists of N fermions initially confined on one side of a\npartition in a box. The partition is removed and the fermions equilibrate\nextremely quickly in time O(1/N).\n", "id": "1512.02566", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "9 + 10 pages, 5 figures; v2 is expanded to include extended results\n  involving local equilibration on lattice systems, together with new examples\n  and minor improvements", "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cond-mat.quant-gas", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "created": "2015-12-08", "authors": [{"forenames": "Terry", "keyname": "Farrelly", "fullname": "Terry Farrelly"}]}, {"title": "A new way to see inside black holes", "first_author": {"forenames": "R.

When the Fermi length\n$l_F=\\hbar/(v_Fm_{\\text{eff}})$ becomes much longer than the magnetic length\n$l_B=(\\hbar c/eB)^{1/2}$, then the spatial coordinates $X,Y$ of the electron\ncease to commute, $[X,Y]=il_B^2$. As a consequence, localization of the\nelectron becomes limited by Heisenberg uncertainty, and the linear\nbath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic\nenergy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron\nhas no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection\nbetween frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features\nmake quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime $l_F\\gg l_B$, which is\nat the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum\nBrownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation\nderived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of\ncharacterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out\nto be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to\n$t^\\alpha$ and $\\alpha=1$, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality\nconstant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and\ninversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime,\nfriction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We\nalso show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the\nnoncommutative plane for suitably designed metastable potential wells, a\nfeature that might be worth exploiting for storage and protection of quantum\ninformation.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "quant-ph"], "created": "2016-02-01"}, {"title": "The Role of Short-Range Order and Hyperuniformity in the Formation of\n  Band Gaps in Disordered Photonic Materials", "first_author": {"forenames": "Luis S.", "keyname": "Froufe-P\u00e9rez", "fullname": "Luis S.

We used the mean square notion for stochastic stability to address the\nanalysis and controller synthesis problems of linear networked systems. These\nresults generalize existing results on stability analysis and controller\nsynthesis from discrete-time linear systems to continuous-time linear systems\nwith multiplicative uncertainty. Necessary, sufficient conditions for mean\nsquare exponential stability are expressed in terms of the input-output\nproperty of deterministic or nominal system dynamics captured by the mean\nsquare system norm and variance of channel uncertainty. The stability results\ncan also be interpreted as small gain theorem for continuous-time stochastic\nsystems. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI)-based optimization formulation is\nprovided for the computation of mean square system norm for stability analysis\nand controller synthesis. For a special case of single input channel\nuncertainty, we also prove a fundamental limitation result that arise in the\nmean square exponential stabilization of continuous-time linear systems.\nSimulation results are presented for WSCC 9 bus power system to demonstrate the\napplication of developed framework.\n", "id": "1602.02857", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Sai", "keyname": "Pushpak", "fullname": "Sai Pushpak"}, "updated": "2016-06-20", "categories": ["math.OC"], "created": "2016-02-08", "authors": [{"forenames": "Sai", "keyname": "Pushpak", "fullname": "Sai Pushpak"}, {"forenames": "Amit", "keyname": "Diwadkar", "fullname": "Amit Diwadkar"}, {"forenames": "Umesh", "keyname": "Vaidya", "fullname": "Umesh Vaidya"}]}, {"msc-class": "34L20, 82B44, 60H25, 37A30", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "Anish", "keyname": "Mallick", "fullname": "Anish Mallick"}, {"forenames": "Dhriti Ranjan", "keyname": "Dolai", "fullname": "Dhriti Ranjan Dolai"}], "title": "Spectral Statistics for one dimensional Anderson model with unbounded\n  but decaying potential", "first_author": {"forenames": "Anish", "keyname": "Mallick", "fullname": "Anish Mallick"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "id": "1602.02986", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "abstract": "  In this work we study the spectral statistics for Anderson model on\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{N})$ with decaying randomness whose single site distribution\nhas unbounded support.

As a typical classification problem, face attribute prediction\nhas been addressed using deep learning. Current state-of-the-art performance\nwas achieved by using two cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which\nwere specifically trained to learn face localization and attribute description.\nIn this paper, we experiment with an alternative way of employing the power of\ndeep representations from CNNs.

It was shown that the Dirac magnon\nHamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo\nspins and are robust against magnon-magnon interactions. The Dirac points also\noccur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple realization of\nnontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system. We show that the Dirac\npoints are gapped when the inversion symmetry of the lattice is broken by\nintroducing a next-nearest neighbour Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction.\nThus, the system realizes magnon edge states similar to Haldane model for\nquantum anomalous Hall effect in electronic systems. However, in contrast to\nelectronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to Ohmic\nheating, the magnon edge states can propagate for long time without dissipation\nas magnons are uncharged particles in contrast to electrons. We observe the\nsame magnon edge states for the XY model on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably,\nin this case the model maps to interacting hardcore bosons on the honeycomb\nlattice. Quantum magnetic systems with nontrivial magnon edge states are called\ntopological magnon insulators.

We refer to the classical concept\nof structured programming, as described by Dijkstra. By employing a graph model\nand graph-theoretic techniques, we formulate an efficient algorithm for\nanswering this question. To do so, we first introduce the class of graphs which\ncorrespond to structured programs, which we call Dijkstra Graphs. Our problem\nthen becomes the recognition of such graphs, for which we present a greedy\n$O(n)$-time algorithm.

These events are often coincident\nwith high energy gamma-ray flares and they have attracted considerable\nattention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic field structure in the\ngamma-ray emitting region of the jet. The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which\nis then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability\nmodels against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation\ncharacteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux\nstates, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a\nstochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process\nduring the flaring activity.\n", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.CO"], "created": "2016-03-01"}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-21", "journal-ref": "J.

Recent studies have found support for the hypothesis that the\ngamma-ray and microwave emission can both be understood as arising from a hard\ncosmic-ray electron population within the volume of the Bubbles, via inverse\nCompton scattering and synchrotron radiation respectively. The relative rates\nof these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar\nradiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; consequently, under\nthe hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and\nmicrowave measurements can be used to estimate the magnetic field within the\nBubbles. We revisit the consistency of this hypothesis on a\nlatitude-by-latitude basis, using data from Fermi, WMAP and Planck; estimate\nthe variation of the electron spectrum within the Bubbles; and infer bounds on\nthe magnetic field within the Bubbles as a function of distance from the\nGalactic plane. We find that while the microwave and gamma-ray spectra are\ngenerally consistent with the leptonic hypothesis for few-microGauss magnetic\nfields, there appears to be a preference for spectral hardening in the\nmicrowaves at mid-latitudes (especially in the |b|~ 25-35 degree range) that is\nnot mirrored in the gamma rays. This result may hint at a non-leptonic\ncontribution to the gamma-ray spectra; however, the discrepancy can be\nreconciled in purely leptonic models if the cutoff energy for the electrons is\nlower in this latitude range and the spectrum below the cutoff is harder.\n", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE"], "created": "2016-03-21"}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-18", "journal-ref": "Phys.

A prominent example for such a\nscenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge\ntheir parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While\nquantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply\nthat no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.\nWe also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and\nshow that the bound is tight for all pure states.

Since the tree amplitude is known at the leading order in\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}/m_{b}$ and is consistent with the measured tree-dominated\ndecay rates, the QCDF value for the tree amplitude can be used with the\nmeasured decay rates to obtain the phases in $B\\to K\\pi$,$K\\rho$, and $\nK^{*}\\pi$ decay rates.

When the normal bands DOS' are mismatched, $N_{n1}\\ne N_{n2}$, the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ is suppressed even in the absence of interband\nscattering, $T_c(N_{n1})$ has a dome-like shape. With increasing interband\nscattering, the London penetration depth at low temperatures evolves from being\nexponentially flat to the power-law and even to near linear behavior in the\ngapless state, the latter being easily misinterpreted as caused by order\nparameter nodes.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.supr-con"], "created": "2016-04-01"}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-04-01", "authors": [{"forenames": "Antonio", "keyname": "Mandarino", "fullname": "Antonio Mandarino"}, {"forenames": "Matteo", "keyname": "Bina", "fullname": "Matteo Bina"}, {"forenames": "Carmen", "keyname": "Porto", "fullname": "Carmen Porto"}, {"forenames": "Simone", "keyname": "Cialdi", "fullname": "Simone Cialdi"}, {"forenames": "Stefano", "keyname": "Olivares", "fullname": "Stefano Olivares"}, {"forenames": "Matteo G.

First, the mode-width\nprobability density function (PDF) is introduced as a powerful statistical tool\nto study and compare the transverse Anderson localization properties of a\ndisordered one dimensional optical waveguide. Second, by analyzing the scaling\nproperties of the mode-width PDF with the transverse size of the waveguide, it\nis shown that the mode-width PDF gradually converges to a terminal\nconfiguration. Therefore, it may not be necessary to study a real-sized\ndisordered structure in order to obtain its statistical localization properties\nand the same PDF can be obtained for a substantially smaller structure. This\nobservation is important because it can reduce the often demanding\ncomputational effort that is required to study the statistical properties of\nAnderson localization in disordered waveguides. Using the mode-width PDF,\nsubstantial information about the impact of the waveguide parameters on its\nlocalization properties is extracted. This information is generally obscured\nwhen disordered waveguides are analyzed using other techniques such as the beam\npropagation method.

Such topics are obscured\nby the widespread use of sparse binary network models which are fundamentally\ndifferent to the complete weighted networks derived from functional\nconnectivity. We offer an alternative framework for functional brain networks\ndesigned specifically for CWN analysis, generalising widely used binary network\nmodels to CWN form and analysing the main topological features of brain\nnetworks- integration, regularity and modularity- over the full range of\ndensities. Importantly, we introduce two techniques to probe the hierarchical\ncomplexity of topologies which complement and enhance this framework. Firstly,\na new metric to measure hierarchical complexity, secondly, a Weighted Complex\nHierarchy (WCH) null model for EEG functional connectivity. By controlling the\nparameters of the model, the highest complexity is found to arises between a\nrandom topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. Further, the model has\nequivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance.\nHierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences\nbetween different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric\nand our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the\nstandard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities. Our\nmetric and model provide a full characterisation of hierarchical complexity.\nImportantly, our framework shows a scale of complexity arising between random\nand regular topologies at one extreme and star and strict 'class-based'\ntopologies at the other.\n", "id": "1604.01680", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Keith", "keyname": "Smith", "fullname": "Keith Smith"}, "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["q-bio.NC"], "created": "2016-04-06", "authors": [{"forenames": "Keith", "keyname": "Smith", "fullname": "Keith Smith"}, {"forenames": "Javier", "keyname": "Escudero", "fullname": "Javier Escudero"}]}, {"license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "updated": "2016-06-06", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Moreover, with a fixed large pure spin injection, we\npredict the build-up of a steady-state valley polarization during the spin\ndiffusion with the maximum along the diffusion direction being capable of\nexceeding 1 %.

Three\ndifferent spectral setups are available, i) a low-resolution V500 setup\ncovering the wavelength range 3749-7500 AA (4240-7140 AA unvignetted) with a\nspectral resolution of 6.0 AA (FWHM), for 646 galaxies, ii) a medium-resolution\nV1200 setup covering the wavelength range 3650-4840 AA (3650-4620 AA\nunvignetted) with a spectral resolution of 2.3 AA (FWHM), for 484 galaxies, and\niii) the combination of the cubes from both setups (called COMBO), with a\nspectral resolution of 6.0 AA and a wavelength range between 3700-7500 AA\n(3700-7140 AA unvignetted), for 446 galaxies. The Main Sample, selected and\nobserved according to the CALIFA survey strategy covers a redshift range\nbetween 0.005 and 0.03, spans the color-magnitude diagram and probes a wide\nrange of stellar mass, ionization conditions, and morphological types.

The former typically provide more insight into\ncognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently\nsurfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning\napproach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of\nexercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning\nperformance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge\ntracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's\nadvantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that\nDKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity\nthat BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence,\ninter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate\nthat when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical\nregularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT\nachieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue\nthat while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling\nstudent learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel\nrepresentations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the\nquestion posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not\nrequire `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us\ngreater interpretability and explanatory power.\n", "id": "1604.02416", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures", "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "created": "2016-03-14", "authors": [{"forenames": "Mohammad", "keyname": "Khajah", "fullname": "Mohammad Khajah"}, {"forenames": "Robert V.", "keyname": "Lindsey", "fullname": "Robert V.

In steels, the most common\nmodels of ORs are the ones by Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) and Kurdjumov-Sachs\n(KS). The defining feature of these and other OR models is the matching of\ndirections and planes in the parent face-centred cubic $\\gamma$-phase to ones\nin the product body-centred cubic/tetragonal $\\alpha/\\alpha'$-phase.\n  In this paper a novel method that identifies transformation strains with ORs\nis introduced and used to develop a new strain-based approach to phase\ntransformation models in steels. Using this approach, it is shown that the\ntransformation strains that leave a close packed plane in the $\\gamma$-phase\nand a close packed direction within that plane unrotated are precisely those\ngiving rise to the NW and KS ORs when a cubic product phase is considered.\nFurther, it is outlined how, by choosing different pairs of unrotated planes\nand directions, other common ORs such as the ones by Pitsch (PT) and\nGreninger-Troiano (GT) can be derived.\n  One of the advantages of our approach is that it leads to a natural\ngeneralisation of the NW, KS and other ORs for different ratios of\ntetragonality $r$ of the product bct $\\alpha'$-phase.

Recently, thermal Hall effect of spin\nexcitations have been observed experimentally in two-dimensional (2D)\nsingle-layer kagome magnet Cu(1-3, bdc) without inversion symmetry, which\nallows a nearest-neighbour chiral Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI).\nRecent theoretical studies have shown that they can also be accessible in a\nhoneycomb lattice ferromagnet in which a next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) DMI is\nallowed by the triangular plaquettes of the NNN sites. Motivated by the fact\nthat many bilayer quantum magnets occur in nature, in this paper we generalize\nthe study of thermal Hall transports of magnons to bilayer magnetic systems. We\nshow that bilayer magnetic systems can be coupled either ferromagnetically or\nantiferromagnetically. We study both scenarios on the honeycomb lattice. We\nshow that the system realizes topologically nontrivial magnon bulk bands with\nnon-vanishing Berry curvatures. For ferromagnetically coupled layers, magnon\nedge states are observed and propagate in the same direction on the top and\nbottom layers of the bilayer system, whereas for antiferromagnetically coupled\nlayers, the chiral edge states propagate in opposite directions. Due to\nnon-vanishing of the Berry curvatures induced by the DMI, the bilayer system\nrealizes thermal Hall transports such as magnon Hall effect and spin Nernst\neffect. We show that for ferromagnetically coupled layers, thermal Hall and\nspin Nernst conductivities have a similar trend to that of single layer chiral\nhoneycomb ferromagnet with no sign change. In contrast, for\nantiferromagnetically coupled layers, both conductivities show a sign change as\nthe magnetic field is reversed and thermal Hall conductivity vanish at zero\nfield.\n", "id": "1604.05292", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "9 pages, 11 figures.

Motivated in part by these experiments, we\nperformed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the\nresponse of a PK over a range of mechanical forces ($f$s) and monovalent salt\nconcentrations ($C$s). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce\nthe multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our\nmodel. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent\nagreement with experiments. By varying $f$ and $C$, we calculated the phase\ndiagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct\nintermediate states.

The goal of the present paper is to define and\ninvestigate stored energies that are valid for structures that can support both\nelectric and magnetic current densities. Stored energies normalized with the\ndissipated power give us the Q factor, or antenna Q, for the structure. Lower\nbounds of the Q factor provide information about the available bandwidth for\npassive antennas that can be realized in the structure. The definition that we\npropose is valid beyond the leading order small antenna limit. Our starting\npoint is the energy density with subtracted far-field form which we obtain an\nexplicit and numerically attractive current density representation. This\nrepresentation gives us the insight to propose a coordinate independent stored\nenergy. Furthermore, we find here that lower bounds on antenna Q for structures\nwith e.g. electric dipole radiation can be formulated as convex optimization\nproblems. We determine lower bounds on both open and closed surfaces that\nsupport electric and magnetic current densities.\n  The here derived representation of stored energies has in its electrical\nsmall limit an associated Q factor that agrees with known small antenna bounds.\nThese stored energies have similarities to earlier efforts to define stored\nenergies. However, one of the advantages with this method is the above\nmentioned formulation as convex optimization problems, which makes it easy to\npredict lower bounds for antennas of arbitrary shapes. The present formulation\nalso gives us insight into the components that contribute to Chu's lower bound\nfor spherical shapes.

This means that the concept of \"lowest order bound\nstate\" needs to be defined. In these lectures I discuss the \"Born\" (no loop,\nlowest order in $\\hbar$) approximation. Born level states are bound by gauge\nfields which satisfy the classical field equations.\n  As a check of the method, Positronium states of any momentum are determined\nas eigenstates of the QED Hamiltonian, quantized at equal time. Analogously,\nstates bound by a strong external field $A^\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})$ are found as\neigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian. Their Fock states have dynamically\ncreated $e^+e^-$ pairs, whose distribution is determined by the Dirac wave\nfunction. The linear potential of $D=1+1$ dimensions confines electrons but\nrepels positrons. As a result, the mass spectrum is continuous and the wave\nfunctions have features of both bound states and plane waves.\n  The classical solutions of Gauss' law are explored for hadrons in QCD. A\nnon-vanishing boundary condition at spatial infinity generates a constant\n\\order{\\alpha_s^0} color electric field between quarks of specific colors.\nPoincar\\'e invariance limits the spectrum to color singlet $q\\bar q$ and $qqq$\nstates, which do not generate an external color field. This restricts the\n\\order{\\alpha_s^0} interactions between hadrons to string breaking dynamics as\nin dual diagrams. Light mesons lie on linear Regge and parallel daughter\ntrajectories. There are massless states which may be significant for chiral\nsymmetry breaking.

However, how the feedback energy is\ntransformed into heat, and how the AGN jets heat the intracluster medium (ICM)\nisotropically, still remain elusive. In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary. Throughout the cluster evolution, turbulent energy is\nonly at the percent level compared to gas thermal energy, and thus turbulent\nheating is not the main source of heating in our simulation.\n", "id": "1605.01725", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "17 pages, 12 figures, version accepted to ApJ", "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.GA"], "created": "2016-05-05", "authors": [{"forenames": "H. -Y.

As an application of this result we construct a\npost-quantum cryptographic protocol for differentially private data anlysis in\nthe distributed model.

Modern interlockings are configured using particular data, called\napplication data, reflecting the track layout and defining the actions that the\ninterlocking can take. The safety of the train traffic relies thereby on\napplication data correctness, errors inside them can cause safety issues such\nas derailments or collisions. Given the high level of safety required by such a\nsystem, its verification is a critical concern. In addition to the safety, an\ninterlocking must also ensure that availability properties, stating that no\ntrain would be stopped forever in a station, are satisfied. Most of the\nresearch dealing with this verification relies on model checking. However, due\nto the state space explosion problem, this approach does not scale for large\nstations.

The simulation enables\nthe verification of larger stations, but with no proof that all the interesting\nscenarios are covered by the simulation.

Our findings emphasize the need for a universally\napplicable $1/d$ expansion in liquid-state theory; we conjecture that the\nsystems known to obey hidden scale invariance in three dimensions are those for\nwhich the yet-to-be-developed $1/d$ expansion converges rapidly.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.soft", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "created": "2016-05-19"}, {"title": "R-FCN: Object Detection via Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks", "first_author": {"forenames": "Jifeng", "keyname": "Dai", "fullname": "Jifeng Dai"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "abstract": "  We present region-based, fully convolutional networks for accurate and\nefficient object detection.

The main effects of the secondary on the\ndisc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.\nWe find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular\nor nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in\nshape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase.

Second, we show that increasing\ntransmitter cache memory beyond what is needed to exactly store the entire\nlibrary between all transmitters does not provide more than a constant-factor\nbenefit to the DoF. A consequence is that transmit zero-forcing is not needed\nfor approximate optimality. Third, we derive an interesting trade-off between\nthe receiver memory and the number of transmitters needed for approximately\nmaximal performance. In particular, if each receiver can store a constant\nfraction of the content library, then only a constant number of transmitters\nare needed. In addition, solving the caching problem required formulating and\nsolving a new communication problem, the symmetric multicast X-channel, for\nwhich we provide an exact DoF characterization.\n", "id": "1606.03175", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Jad", "keyname": "Hachem", "fullname": "Jad Hachem"}, "updated": "2016-06-21", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.IT"], "created": "2016-06-10", "authors": [{"forenames": "Jad", "keyname": "Hachem", "fullname": "Jad Hachem"}, {"forenames": "Urs", "keyname": "Niesen", "fullname": "Urs Niesen"}, {"forenames": "Suhas", "keyname": "Diggavi", "fullname": "Suhas Diggavi"}]}, {"title": "Universal relations of strongly interacting Fermi gases with multiple\n  scattering channels", "first_author": {"forenames": "Ran", "keyname": "Qi", "fullname": "Ran Qi"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "abstract": "  Universal relations are important for understanding strongly interacting\nFermi gases, the study of which have been mostly limited to cases with a single\nscattering channel.

The Fe K line flux responds to the\nmajor flare, supporting its disc origin.

Using a\nKempe-chain argument along with the fact that an induced path on three vertices\nis dominating in a graph with independence number two, we first give a very\nshort and computer-free proof of a recent result of Albar and Gon\\c{c}alves and\ngeneralize it to the next step by showing that every graph with no $K_t$ minor\nis $(2t-6)$-colorable, where $t\\in\\{7,8,9\\}$. We then prove that graphs with no\n$K_8^-$ minor are $9$-colorable and graphs with no $K_8^=$ minor are\n$8$-colorable. Finally we prove that if Mader's bound for the extremal function\nfor $K_p$ minors is true, then every graph with no $K_p$ minor is\n$(2t-6)$-colorable for all $p\\ge5$. This implies our first result. We believe\nthat the Kempe-chain method we have developed in this paper is of independent\ninterest.\n", "id": "1606.05507", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Martin", "keyname": "Rolek", "fullname": "Martin Rolek"}, "updated": "2016-06-19", "categories": ["math.CO"], "created": "2016-06-17", "authors": [{"forenames": "Martin", "keyname": "Rolek", "fullname": "Martin Rolek"}, {"forenames": "Zi-Xia", "keyname": "Song", "fullname": "Zi-Xia Song"}]}, {"title": "A class of asymmetric gapped Hamiltonians on quantum spin chains and its\n  characterization III", "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", "updated": "2016-06-17", "id": "1606.05508", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Yoshiko", "keyname": "Ogata", "fullname": "Yoshiko Ogata"}, "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider classification problem of asymmetric gapped\nHamiltonians, which are given as the non-degenerate part of the Hamiltonians\nintroduced in [O1].

Moreover, the\ninteraction mechanisms that have been proposed, magnetic interaction and tidal\ninteraction, exhibit a very different dependence on orbital separation between\nthe star and the planet. A detection of activity enhancement and\ncharacterization of its dependence on planetary orbital distance can, in\nprinciple, allow us to characterize the physical mechanism behind the activity\nenhancement.\n  Methods: We used the HARPS-N spectrograph to measure the stellar activity\nlevel of HD 80606 during the planetary periastron passage and compared the\nactivity measured to that close to apastron. Being characterized by an\neccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme\nvariation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our\nhypothesis.\n  Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the\nstar as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity\nindicators employed log($R'_{HK}$), H$_\\alpha$, NaI, and HeI. None of the\nmodels employed, whether magnetic interaction or tidal interaction, provides a\ngood description of the data.\n  Conclusions: We find no evidence for star-planet interaction in HD\\,80606 at\nthe moment of the periastron passage of its very eccentric planet. The\nstraightforward explanation for the non-detection is the absence of interaction\nas a result of a low magnetic field strength on either the planet or the star\nand of the low level of tidal interaction between the two. However, we cannot\nexclude two scenarios: i) the interaction can be instantaneous and of magnetic\norigin, being concentrated on the substellar point and its surrounding area,\nand ii) the interaction can lead to a delayed activity enhancement.

We find that two independent model parameters,\nnamely the reddening of the accretion disk and the column density of the dusty\ntorus, are good proxies for AGN obscuration, allowing us to develop a strategy\nfor classifying AGN as Type1 or Type2, based solely on an SED-fitting analysis.\nOur classification scheme is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic\nclassification, giving a completeness fraction of $\\sim 86\\%$ and $\\sim 70\\%$,\nand an efficiency of $\\sim 80\\%$ and $\\sim 77\\%$, for Type1 and Type2 AGNs,\nrespectively.\n", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA", "astro-ph.IM"], "created": "2016-06-17", "authors": [{"forenames": "Gabriela Calistro", "keyname": "Rivera", "fullname": "Gabriela Calistro Rivera"}, {"forenames": "Elisabeta", "keyname": "Lusso", "fullname": "Elisabeta Lusso"}, {"forenames": "Joseph F.", "keyname": "Hennawi", "fullname": "Joseph F.

Galaxy clusters are continuously growing through the accretion of\nmatter in their outskirts. This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas\ndensity distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover\nthe physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.\nWe studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile\nmeasured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial\nprofiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a\nmethod that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we\ncompared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.\nWhen taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is\nconsistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a\nsignificant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is\nneglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data\nagrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass\nreconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.\nConclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed\nby Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive\nto clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic\nproperties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal\ngas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion\nshocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics.

Yet, the full star\nformation and enrichment history of a galaxy can be traced directly only if two\nkey observables can be determined for large stellar samples - age and chemical\ncomposition. While spectroscopy is a powerful method to analyse the detailed\nabundances of stars, stellar ages are the \"missing link in the chain\", since\nthey are not a direct observable.

The relation allows to determine stellar masses and ages with\nthe accuracy of 10-15%.

The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE\n802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC)\nusing an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is\nindispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter\nimage sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds,\nsampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional\ncommunications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous\ncommunication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical\nlimitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying\nframe rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed\nperformance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of\ncamera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested\nalong with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms.\nA significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support\nboth typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low\nframe rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate\nis lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no\nless than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority\nvoting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when\nthe frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by\nan error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in\ndecoding and later corrected by external code.

This occurred in a situation where a wide\ngap separated the competence of group members. We discuss the main properties\nof the kinetic models and numerically investigate some examples of collective\ndecision under the influence of the equality bias.

First of\nall, the regions confining the transceivers are assumed to be filled with\ndielectric, which is either lossy or lossless. Then, for capacity analysis, we\nuse the exact power consumption that takes into account the electromagnetic\ninteraction between the field and the source. In addition, the exact noise\nmodel followed from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in thermodynamics is\nused at the receive side. The contribution of our work is summarized as\nfollows. First, we characterize the channel capacity as a function of the size\nand the physical property of the regions confining the transceivers and\nanalytically show how the radiation efficiency affects the capacity. We also\nshow that the outgoing channel at the transmit side and the incoming channel at\nthe receive side are information-theoretically equivalent, and thus, the\ncapacities of both channels are the same. Additionally, the quality factor,\nwhich is inversely proportional to the bandwidth, is theoretically derived, and\nthe relationship between the spatial degrees of freedom of the channel and the\nquality factor is analyzed. Besides, we consider how the power consumption is\naffected by the backscattered waves and compare the recent experimental\ndemonstration with our work by solving the gain-optimization problem with the\nconstraint on the quality factor.\n", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.IT"], "created": "2016-06-18", "authors": [{"forenames": "Wonseok", "keyname": "Jeon", "fullname": "Wonseok Jeon"}, {"forenames": "Sae-Young", "keyname": "Chung", "fullname": "Sae-Young Chung"}]}, {"title": "Measurement-induced state transitions in a superconducting qubit: Beyond\n  the rotating wave approximation", "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:11:56Z", "updated": "2016-06-18", "id": "1606.05721", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Daniel", "keyname": "Sank", "fullname": "Daniel Sank"}, "abstract": "  Many superconducting qubit systems use the dispersive interaction between the\nqubit and a coupled harmonic resonator to perform quantum state measurement.\nPrevious works have found that such measurements can induce state transitions\nin the qubit if the number of photons in the resonator is too high.

On OSNs, a user\nswitches roles constantly between content generator and content receiver. The\ngoals and softgoals are different when the user is generating a post, as\nopposed as replying to a post. In other words, the user is generating instances\nof different entities, depending on the role she has: a generator generates\ninstances of a \"post\", while the receiver generates instances of a \"reply\".\nTherefore, we believe that when addressing Requirements Engineering (RE) for\nRS, it is necessary to distinguish these roles clearly.\n  We aim to model an essential dynamic on OSN, namely that when a user creates\n(posts) content, other users can ignore that content, or themselves start\ngenerating new content in reply, or react to the initial posting. This dynamic\nis key to designing OSNs, because it influences how active users are, and how\nattractive the OSN is for existing, and to new users. We apply a well-known\nGoal Oriented RE (GORE) technique, namely i-star, and show that this language\nfails to capture this dynamic, and thus cannot be used alone to model the\nproblem domain. Hence, in order to represent this dynamic, its relationships to\nother OSNs' requirements, and to capture all relevant information, we suggest\nusing another modelling language, namely Petri Nets, on top of i-star for the\nmodelling of the problem domain.

The microscopic origin of this mobility decrease is attributed to a ~ 2\nnm-thick amorphous surface oxide layer that introduces disorder. The oxide\nlayer also shifts the Fermi level by ~ 300 meV at the $WTe_2$ surface. However,\nband bending due to this Fermi level shift is not the dominant cause for the\nsuppression of magnetoresistance as the electron and hole carrier densities are\nbalanced down to ~ 13 nm based on the two-band model.

The\nobjective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base\nstation (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to\nsatisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS\noffloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and\nshow that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading\nscheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC)\nto minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph\nmodel to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in\nterms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover,\ndespite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case,\nwe prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for\nlarge number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell\noffloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the\nONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph\nor broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using\nthe minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual\ngraph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate\ngraph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the\nONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal\nONC-broadcast scheme.\n", "categories": ["cs.NI"], "created": "2016-06-18", "authors": [{"forenames": "Yousef N.", "keyname": "Shnaiwer", "fullname": "Yousef N.

At large amplitudes of the driving field, the dynamics of\nparticles resembles an ordinary random walk with a frequency-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient. However, subdiffusive and oscillatory dynamics at short\ntime scales is observed when decreasing the amplitude.

Multiscale energy equations\nare derived using a new analysis apparatus, namely, multiscale window\ntransform, with respect to both the primitive equation and quasi-geostrophic\nmodels. A reconstruction of the \"atomic\" energy fluxes on the multiple scale\nwindows allows for a natural and unique separation of the in-scale transports\nand cross-scale transfers from the intertwined nonlinear processes. The\nresulting energy transfers bear a Lie bracket form, reminiscent of the Poisson\nbracket in Hamiltonian mechanics, we hence would call them \"canonical\". A\ncanonical transfer process is a mere redistribution of energy among scale\nwindows, without generating or destroying energy as a whole. By classification,\na multiscale energetic cycle comprises of available potential energy (APE)\ntransport, kinetic energy (KE) transport, pressure work, buoyancy conversion,\nwork done by external forcing and friction, and the cross-scale canonical\ntransfers of APE and KE which correspond respectively to the baroclinic and\nbarotropic instabilities, among others, in geophysical fluid dynamics. A\nbuoyancy conversion takes place in an individual window only, bridging the two\ntypes of energy namely KE and APE, it does not involve any processes among\ndifferent scale windows, and is hence basically not related to instabilities.\nThis formalism is exemplified with a preliminary application to the\nMadden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) study.\n", "categories": ["physics.ao-ph"], "created": "2016-06-18"}, {"title": "Scalability of VM Provisioning Systems", "first_author": {"forenames": "Mike", "keyname": "Jones", "fullname": "Mike Jones"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:11:56Z", "updated": "2016-06-18", "id": "1606.05794", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "5 pages; 6 figures; accepted to the IEEE High Performance Extreme\n  Computing (HPEC) conference 2016", "abstract": "  Virtual machines and virtualized hardware have been around for over half a\ncentury.

An extension of the model to include additional fermions with\nthe new gauge coupling, though not as simple and elegant, can address both\nissues and more. It allows the massive vector boson to decay into a colorless,\nneutral state that could be a candidate of the dark matter.

According to that study a toxin expelled by one of the\nstrains can be responsible for the stable maintenance of the two strain types.\nWe propose a resource-based model in which an efficient strain with a slow\nmetabolic rate competes with a second strain type which presents a fast but\ninefficient metabolism. Moreover, the model assumes that the inefficient strain\nproduces a toxin as a byproduct. This toxin affects the growth rate of both\nstrains with different strength. Through an extensive exploration of the\nparameter space we determine the situations at which the coexistence of the two\nstrains is possible. Interestingly, we observe that the resource influx rate\nplays a key role in the maintenance of the two strain types.

Recent works have started to\ninvestigate the possibility to use receivers based on energy detection (ED),\nwhere a single data stream is decoded based on the channel and noise energy.\nThe asymptotic features of the massive receiver array lead to a system where\nthe impact of the noise becomes predictable due to a noise hardening effect.\nThis in effect extends the communication range compared to the receiver with a\nsmall number of antennas, as the latter is limited by the unpredictability of\nthe additive noise. When the channel has a large number of spatial degrees of\nfreedom, the system becomes robust to imperfect channel knowledge due to\nchannel hardening. We propose two detection methods based on the instantaneous\nand average channel energy, respectively. Meanwhile, we design the detection\nthresholds based on the asymptotic properties of the received energy.\nDifferently from existing works, we analyze the scaling law behavior of the\nsymbol-error-rate (SER). When the instantaneous channel energy is known, the\nperformance of ED approaches that of the coherent detection in high SNR\nscenarios. When the receiver relies on the average channel energy, our\nperformance analysis is based on the exact SER, rather than an approximation.\nIt is shown that the logarithm of SER decreases linearly as a function of the\nnumber of antennas. Additionally, a saturation appears at high SNR for PAM\nconstellations of order larger than two, due to the uncertainty on the channel\nenergy.

We conclude\nthat the intrinsic starspot evolution, although very slow, has a significant\nimpact on the determination of the differential rotation by means of our spot\nmodelling approach. We estimate typical timescales for the evolution of the\nstarspot pattern between about 20 and 50 rotation periods in our stars.\n", "categories": ["astro-ph.SR", "astro-ph.IM"], "created": "2016-06-20", "authors": [{"forenames": "A.

These detections have\nstrengthened our long held belief that compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are\nthe most promising GW detection prospects accessible to ground-based\ninterferometric detectors. For detecting CBC signals it is of vital importance\nto characterize and identify non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise in these\ndetectors. In this work we model two important classes of transient artifacts\nthat contribute to this noise and adversely affect the detector sensitivity to\nCBC signals. One of them is the sine-Gaussian \"glitch\", characterized by a\ncentral frequency $f_0$ and a quality factor $Q$ and the other is the chirping\nsine-Gaussian glitch, which is characterized by $f_0$, $Q$ as well as a chirp\nparameter. We study the response a bank of compact binary inspiral templates\nhas to these two families of glitches when they are used to match-filter data\ncontaining any of these glitches. Two important characteristics of this\nresponse are the distributions of the SNR and the time-lag of individual\ntemplates. We show how these distributions differ from those when the detector\ndata has a real CBC signal instead of a glitch. We argue that these\ndistinctions can be utilized to develop useful signal-artifact discriminators\nthat add negligibly to the computational cost of a CBC search and can therefore\nhelp improve the sensitivity of low-latency CBC searches. Specifically, we show\nhow the central frequency of a glitch can be used to set adaptive time-windows\naround it so that any template trigger occurring in that window can be\nquarantined for further vetting of its supposed astrophysical nature.

We also extend\nautomatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with\nnon-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations,\nbanks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day\n(risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time\nconsuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software\nfor this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable\nfunctions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato\nat core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and\npathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time,\nstability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of\nthe full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second\nderivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite\ndifference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its\nprecision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the\nincrement. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty\nand its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in\nfinance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives\nhave to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the\nprecision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nfeasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare\nVibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show\nthat it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise\nfor second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato.

Correspondingly, in quantum theory the charges\nare neither conserved nor vanish, but non-conservation time is set by $t_{BH}$.\nThis picture nicely matches with the idea of a black hole as of critical system\ncomposed of many soft gravitons. The A-Goldstones of geometric picture\nrepresent the near-gapless Bogoliubov-Goldstone modes of critical soft-graviton\nsystem.\n", "categories": ["hep-th"], "created": "2016-06-20", "authors": [{"forenames": "Artem", "keyname": "Averin", "fullname": "Artem Averin"}, {"forenames": "Gia", "keyname": "Dvali", "fullname": "Gia Dvali"}, {"forenames": "Cesar", "keyname": "Gomez", "fullname": "Cesar Gomez"}, {"forenames": "Dieter", "keyname": "Lust", "fullname": "Dieter Lust"}]}, {"title": "Inverse problems for semilinear wave equations on Lorentzian manifolds", "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:11:56Z", "updated": "2016-06-20", "id": "1606.06261", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "first_author": {"forenames": "Matti", "keyname": "Lassas", "fullname": "Matti Lassas"}, "abstract": "  We consider inverse problems in space-time $(M, g)$, a $4$-dimensional\nLorentzian manifold.

Let\n$kK_2$ denote the matching of size $k$, that is a graph with $2k$ vertices and\n$k$ disjoint edges. A graph with an induced copy of $kK_2$ contains at least\n$2^k$ maximal independent sets. The other direction was established in a series\nof papers finally yielding $i(G) \\le (n/k)^{2k}$ for a graph $G$ without an\ninduced $(k+1)K_2$. Alekseev proved that $i(G)$ is at most the number of\ninduced matchings of $G$.\n  This work generalises the aforementioned results to clutters. The right\nsubstructures in this setting are minors rather than induced subgraphs. Maximal\nindependent sets of a clutter $\\mathcal{H}$ are in one-to-one correspondence to\nthe sets of its blocker, $b(\\mathcal{H})$, hence $i(\\mathcal{H}) =\n|b(\\mathcal{H})|$.

The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for\nthe HI content of satellites with stellar mass Mstar>10^9 Msun. At a fixed\nMstar, the fraction of HI-depleted satellites increases with increasing host\nhalo mass M200 in response to stronger environmental effects, while at a fixed\nM200 it decreases with increasing satellite Mstar as the gas is confined by\ndeeper gravitational potentials.

Our long-term goal is to explore the heating and dissipation\nrate of the streams and their fragmentation and possible breakup, in order to\nunderstand how galaxies are fed, and how this affects their star-formation rate\nand morphology. We present here the first step, where we analyze the linear\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a cold, dense slab or cylinder flowing\nthrough a hot, dilute medium in the transonic regime. The current analysis is\nlimited to the adiabatic case with no gravity and assuming equal pressure in\nthe stream and the medium. By analytically solving the linear dispersion\nrelation, we find a transition from a dominance of the familiar rapidly growing\nsurface modes in the subsonic regime to more slowly growing body modes in the\nsupersonic regime. The system is parameterized by three parameters: the density\ncontrast between the stream and the medium, the Mach number of stream velocity\nwith respect to the medium, and the stream width with respect to the halo\nvirial radius. We find that a realistic choice for these parameters places the\nstreams near the mode transition, with the KHI exponential-growth time in the\nrange 0.01-10 virial crossing times for a perturbation wavelength comparable to\nthe stream width. We confirm our analytic predictions with idealized\nhydrodynamical simulations. Our linear-KHI estimates thus indicate that KHI may\nin principle be effective in the evolution of streams by the time they reach\nthe galaxy.

First, while colorization for artistic\npurposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for\ncompression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to\nthe ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple\npossible colors.

Recent breakthroughs\nin ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two\nspecimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is\nfrom a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful.

Using these\npreviously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and\nnon-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify\na greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene\nsequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of\npremature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent\nwith genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the\ndwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island.

Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon\nmesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more\naccurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the\ndiscretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension.\nRecently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times\nhas emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the\nposterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric\nMCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated\ndistributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are\nin general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite\ndimensions.

In this paper, we study the security issue in the mobile\nwireless communication systems by considering the FSMC with an eavesdropper,\nwhich we call the finite state Markov wiretap channel (FSM-WC). More\nspecifically, the FSM-WC is a channel with one input (the transmitter) and two\noutputs (the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper). The transition\nprobability of the FSM-WC is controlled by a channel state which takes values\nin a finite set, and it undergoes a Markov process.

The presence of warm\ndusty disks around brown dwarfs is well known, based on near- and mid-infrared\nstudies. High angular resolution observations of the cold outer disk are\nlimited, we used ALMA to attempt a first survey of young brown dwarfs in the\nrho-Ophiuchi star forming region with ALMA. All 17 young brown dwarfs in our\nsample were observed at 890 um in the continuum at ~0.5\" angular resolution.\nThe sensitivity of our observations was chosen to detect ~0.5 MEarth of dust.\nWe detect continuum emission in 11 disks (65% of the total), the estimated mass\nof dust in the detected disks ranges from ~0.5 to ~6 MEarth. These disk masses\nimply that planet formation around brown dwarfs may be relatively rare and that\nthe supra-Jupiter mass companions found around some brown dwarfs are probably\nthe result of a binary system formation. We find evidence that the two\nbrightest disks in rho-Oph have sharp outer edges at R~25 AU, as opposite to\ndisks around Taurus brown dwarfs.

Validation based on Apache Storm demonstrates that our\napproach locates optimal configurations within a limited experimental budget,\nwith an improvement of SPS performance typically of at least an order of\nmagnitude compared to existing configuration algorithms.\n", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "created": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "Pooyan", "keyname": "Jamshidi", "fullname": "Pooyan Jamshidi"}, {"forenames": "Giuliano", "keyname": "Casale", "fullname": "Giuliano Casale"}]}, {"title": "Pre-explosion dynamo in the cores of massive stars", "first_author": {"forenames": "Noam", "keyname": "Soker", "fullname": "Noam Soker", "affiliation": "Technion, Israel"}, "fetched": "2016-06-22T11:11:56Z", "updated": "2016-06-21", "id": "1606.06544", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "comments": "Submitted", "abstract": "  We propose a speculative scenario where dynamo amplification of magnetic\nfields in the core convective shells of massive stars, tens of years to hours\nbefore they explode, leads to envelope expansion and enhanced mass loss rate,\nresulting in pre-explosion outbursts (PEOs).

Another source of critical uncertainty is the\nspatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance which plays a key role in the\npropagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A\ncontinuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic\nrandom field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Resorting to\na stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the spatial\nsensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude with respect\nto the different model uncertainties.

To correctly understand\nthe elastic modulus $M$, it is therefore necessary to take into account not\nonly the affine modulus $M_A$, but also the non-affine modulus $M_N$ that\narises from the non-affine deformation. In the present work, we study the bulk\n($M=K$) and shear ($M=G$) moduli in static jammed particulate packings over a\nrange of packing fractions $\\varphi$. One novelty of this work is to elucidate\nthe contribution of each vibrational mode to the non-affine $M_N$ through a\nmodal decomposition of the displacement and force fields. In the vicinity of\nthe (un)jamming transition, $\\varphi_{c}$, the vibrational density of states,\n$g(\\omega)$, shows a plateau in the intermediate frequency regime above a\ncharacteristic frequency $\\omega^\\ast$.

These studies\nwere carried out in a micro-scale fiber waveguide where the acoustic\nintensities necessary to manipulate phonon dissipation can be achieved with\noptically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple\nmodel that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by\nphononic saturation. In showing how the dissipative and dispersive properties\nof glasses can be manipulated using external fields, we open the door to\ndynamical phononic switching and the use of glasses as low loss phononic media\nwhich may enable new forms of controllable laser dynamics, information\nprocessing, and precision metrology.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cond-mat.mes-hall"], "created": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "R.

The \\b{eta} ~ -1 implies a non-equilibrium Kondo-like effect near\nthe quantum critical phase transition. The bias current dependence can be\nunderstood as an interplay between the Coulomb repulsive energy (U) and tunnel\ncoupling ({\\Gamma}) between diamond grains or intra-grain superconducting\nregions separated by magnetic regions that result from external flux\npenetration induced vortices. The anomalous peak in the R(T) and\nmagnetoresistance data as well as the coherence peaks in differential\nconductance vs. I plots can be attributed to regions within\ncharge-Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and vortex-BKT transitions.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.supr-con"], "created": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "D.", "keyname": "Mtsuko", "fullname": "D.

Therefore the optimal scheduler is determined using an iterative\nprocess to determine the optimal time-sharing between all priority scheduling\npolicies, such that it results in maximum system utility. The proposed\nscheduler can be implemented online with reduced complexity due to the\niterative optimization process. We then extend this work to determine jointly\noptimal MA-AS channel allocation and packet scheduling scheme at the MAs and\nAS.

To achieve this objective, intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.\nHowever, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce false\nalarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated for\nany potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase the\noperational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, as\noversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher number\nof false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the false\nalarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks. The configuration of\nIDS to strike the right balance between time to detecting attacks and the rate\nof false positives is a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments,\nin which the damage incurred by a successful attack is time-varying.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal detection thresholds\nfor anomaly-based detectors implemented in dynamical systems in the face of\nstrategic attacks. We formulate the problem as an attacker-defender security\ngame, and determine thresholds for the detector to achieve an optimal trade-off\nbetween the detection delay and the false positive rates. In this direction,\nfirst, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal fixed threshold that\nremains fixed throughout. Second, we allow detector's threshold to change with\ntime to further minimize the defender's loss and provide an algorithm to\ncompute time-varying thresholds, which we call adaptive thresholds.

Our analysis shows that\nwhen the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough,\nthere is chaos in the demand-supply dynamics. Our numerical simulation shows\nthat such a chaos is not an attractor (i.e. dynamics is not approaching the\nchaos), instead a periodic attractor (of period 3 under the Poincar\\'e period\nmap) exists near the chaos, and co-exists with another periodic attractor (of\nperiod 1 under the Poincar\\'e period map) near the market equilibrium. Outside\nthe basins of attraction of the two periodic attractors, the dynamics\napproaches infinity indicating market irrational exuberance or flash crash. The\nperiod 3 attractor represents the product's market cycle of growth and\nrecession, while period 1 attractor near the market equilibrium represents the\nregular fluctuation of the product's market. Thus our model captures more\nmarket phenomena besides Marshall's market equilibrium. When the fluctuation of\nthe determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, a three leaf danger\nzone exists where the basins of attraction of all attractors intertwine and\nfractal basin boundaries are formed. Small perturbations in the danger zone can\nlead to very different attractors. That is, small perturbations in the danger\nzone can cause the market to experience oscillation near market equilibrium,\nlarge growth and recession cycle, and irrational exuberance or flash crash.\n", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "nlin.CD"], "created": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "Y.

With increasing\namount of Cd, the hybridization between Yb $4f$ electrons and the conduction\nelectrons is weakened, as evidenced by a decrease in the Sommerfeld\ncoefficient, which should be accompanied by a valence shift of the Yb$^{3+}$\ndue to the negative chemical pressure effect. This scenario is also supported\nby the low temperature dc-magnetic susceptibility, that is gradually suppressed\nand evidences an increment of the Kondo temperature, based on a shift to higher\ntemperatures of the characteristic broad susceptibility peak. Furthermore, the\nDC resistivity decreases with the isoelectronic Cd substitution for Zn,\ncontrary to the expectation for an increasingly disordered system, and implying\nthat the valence shift is not related to charge carrier doping. The combined\nresults demonstrate excellent complementarity between positive physical\npressure and negative chemical pressure, and point to a rich playground for\nexploring the physics and chemistry of strongly correlated electron systems in\nthe general family of Zn$_{20}$ compounds, despite their structural complexity.\n", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el"], "created": "2016-06-21", "authors": [{"forenames": "Michael", "keyname": "Cabrera-Baez", "fullname": "Michael Cabrera-Baez"}, {"forenames": "Raquel A.", "keyname": "Ribeiro", "fullname": "Raquel A.

However, evolution via the slingshot mechanism may\nbe ineffective if the reservoir of interacting stars is not readily\nreplenished, and the binary shrinking may come to a halt at roughly a parsec\nseparation. Recent simulations suggest that the departure from spherical\nsymmetry, naturally produced in merger remnants, leads to efficient loss cone\nrefilling, preventing the binary from stalling. However, current N-body\nsimulations able to accurately follow the evolution of BHBs are limited to very\nmodest particle numbers.

We simulate mergers with various particle numbers (from 8k to 1M) and\nwith several density profiles. Moreover, we compare simulations where the BHB\nis fixed at the centre of the merger remnant with simulations where the BHB is\nfree to random walk.
